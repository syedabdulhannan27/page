            This project introduces CoLMbo, an innovative Speaker Language Model designed to generate descriptive speaker profiles in natural language. By integrating a robust speaker encoder with prompt-based conditioning, CoLMbo can produce detailed captions that capture attributes such as age, gender, accent, and dialect. The model's ability to adapt to user-defined prompts makes it versatile for various applications, including forensics, customer service, and healthcare. CoLMbo leverages advanced language modeling techniques and speaker embeddings to provide context-rich and explainable profiles, setting a new benchmark in speaker recognition systems.
