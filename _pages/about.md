I am a graduate student from Carnegie Mellon University with a Specialized focus in AI/ML. I have extensive knowledge and experience in building deep learning models for different tasks such as Speech Language Model, Vision/Speech Models for Verification, etc. and have implemented them in various fields such as security, language models, and navigations.
